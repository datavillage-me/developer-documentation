With Datavillage, you can combine personal, sensitive or proprietary data between partners and run AI algorithms without disclosing any information.
Datavillage simplifies the governance of sharing data and running algorithms in fully confidential environments, allowing participants to spend more time on getting the most of their data.
You can use Datavillage to let data consumers train and run their AI algorithms   

You can use Segment to track events that happen when a user interacts with the interfaces. “Interfaces” is Segment’s generic word for any digital properties you own: your website, mobile apps, and processes that run on a server or OTT device.

When you capture interaction data in Segment, you can send it (often in real-time) to your marketing, product, and analytics tools, as well as to data warehouses. In most cases, you won’t even need to touch your tracking code to connect to new tools.
