{: .fs-8 }

Datavillage enables organizations to process sensitive and personal information in an interoperable way with other parties (organizations or individuals) while ensuring control of data and algorithms throughout the collaboration process. Organizations can access data without collecting it on their system and they can share data without fear of it being misused or of losing their competitive advantage. It's about <b>sharing without showing</b>.

Datavillage provides the <b>privacy-preserving data collaboration platform</b> and <b>developer APIss</b> implementing privacy by design and automating trusted and transparent data collaboration.

Privacy by design is implemented based on end-to-end data encryption and transparent governance:
- Data are encrypted at rest and in transit
- Data are encrypted while beeing processed
- Confidential algorythm is running is a fully sandboxed environment
- Only derived data can be accessed by data consumer
- Individuals are in control of their data and can join collaborations with explicit consent
